  - Action confirmations

## Components

### Services
- `EmergencyService`: Core service for managing emergencies
- `NotificationService`: Handles emergency notifications
- `AccessManagementService`: Manages emergency access controls
- `AuditService`: Records all emergency-related actions

### Hooks
- `useEmergency`: React hook for emergency state management
- `useAccess`: Hook for managing emergency access

## Protocol System
Each emergency type has a predefined protocol template that includes:
- Required steps and actions
- Completion criteria
- Time limits
- Required roles
- Escalation paths
- Auto-notification rules

## Usage

```typescript
// Declare an emergency
const { declareEmergency } = useEmergency();
await declareEmergency(EmergencyType.MEDICAL, location, details);

// Record an action
const { recordAction } = useEmergency(incidentId);
await recordAction({
  type: 'ACTION',
  details: 'Performed initial assessment',
  protocolStepId: 'step-1'
});

// Update status
const { updateStatus } = useEmergency(incidentId);
await updateStatus('IN_PROGRESS');
```

## Integration
