## Purpose

The `care` directory provides foundational components that can be extended or composed
to create specific care implementations. This separation allows for:

1. **Core Logic Reusability**
   - Base components with shared functionality
   - Type-safe interfaces
   - Common utilities and helpers

2. **Compliance Management**
   - Centralized compliance tracking
   - Multi-regulator support (CQC, OFSTED)
   - Automated requirement monitoring

3. **Specialized Care Features**
   - Care-type specific components
   - Customized workflows
   - Targeted functionality

## Mobile-First Design

All components follow mobile-first design principles:

1. **Responsive Layouts**
   - Adaptive grid systems
   - Flexible containers
   - Dynamic spacing

2. **Touch Optimization**
   - Large touch targets
   - Gesture support
   - Quick actions

3. **Accessibility**
   - Screen reader support
   - High contrast modes
   - Voice input options

## Enterprise Features

Components include enterprise-grade capabilities:

1. **Security & Compliance**
   - Role-based access
   - Audit logging
   - Data encryption

2. **Performance**
   - Offline support
   - Optimized rendering
   - State management

3. **Integration**
   - API connectivity
   - Data synchronization
   - Service coordination

## Usage

Base components should be extended or composed when creating specific implementations:

```typescript
import { BaseCareComponent } from './base/BaseCareComponent';
import { ComplianceTracker } from './compliance/ComplianceTracker';

// Extend base component for specific care type
class SpecializedCare extends BaseCareComponent {
  // Add specialized functionality
}

// Compose with compliance tracking
const CompliantCare = () => (
  <SpecializedCare>
    <ComplianceTracker />
  </SpecializedCare>
);
```
