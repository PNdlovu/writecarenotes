// Schedule a new visit
await scheduleVisit({
  roomId: 'room123',
  visitorCount: 2,
  startTime: new Date(),
  endTime: new Date(Date.now() + 3600000),
  screened: false
});

// Check in visitors
await checkInVisitor('schedule123', true);
```

```typescript
const { planTransition, executeTransition } = useCareLevelTransition(facilityId);

// Plan a care level transition
const plan = await planTransition({
  residentId: 'resident123',
  fromLevel: 'INDEPENDENT',
  toLevel: 'ASSISTED',
  reason: 'Increased support needs',
  requiredDate: new Date()
}, currentRoom);

// Execute the transition
await executeTransition(plan.id, 'approver123');
```

### Managing Staff Assignments
```typescript
const { assignStaffMember, requestAdditionalStaff } = useStaffingRequirements(facilityId);

// Assign staff to a shift
await assignStaffMember('staff123', 'DAY', 'zone1');

// Request additional staff
await requestAdditionalStaff({
  nurses: 2,
  caregivers: 3,
  specialists: [{ type: 'PHYSIO', count: 1 }]
}, 'Increased care requirements');
```

## Error Handling
The module includes comprehensive error handling with user-friendly notifications:

```typescript
try {
  await operation();
} catch (error) {
  toast({
    title: 'Error',
    description: 'Operation failed: ' + error.message,
    variant: 'destructive',
  });
}
```

## Best Practices
1. Always use tenant-specific queries
2. Implement proper error handling
3. Consider offline capabilities
4. Validate data before state changes
5. Use TypeScript for type safety
6. Follow React hooks best practices
7. Implement proper security measures

2. Dietary Management Integration
3. Advanced Activity Scheduling
4. Enhanced Reporting Capabilities
5. AI-powered Staff Scheduling
6. Real-time Communication System
7. Family Portal Integration
